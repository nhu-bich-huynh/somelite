# Logging In
You can either create your own account and
password (you don't need a real email to sign up).

Or, you can log into any of our existing users.
For instance, to log into the 'Alice' account you
can use the email 'alice@alice' and the password 'alice'

# Menus
Under the 'Groups' menu tab, you can see all the posts
made by members of different groups. Each one of your
group memberships will have a different tab. Simiarly,
the 'friends' tab will allow you to see the posts made
by each account you are friends with.

# Functions
In addition to viewing posts from friends and groups,
a user can also add posts, and like them, and search for existing
posts using the search fields. This functionality is relatively self-explanitory for
people familiar with navigating social media. Lastly, a user can choose to delete his or her account,
and doing so immediatly deletes all their friendships, posts, group-memberships and all groups that 
they are registered as the owner of.
